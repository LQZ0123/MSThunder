The training data, code, model parameters and candidates used for training and prediction are available through our experiments conducted on an Ubuntu 20.04 environment. The interface mode of MSThunder is available by decompressing in the file in RAR format(msthunder.rar and msthunderfile.rar). The files of “msthunderfile.rar” need to be unzipped under the folder of the “msthunder”. A case file named “Pesticides” can be run in the Windows environment equipped with 16 GB of RAM and a 2 GB NVIDIA GPU. If you want to analyze other data on UPLC-HRMS, you can send the raw file to our e-mail (qzliu@rcees.ac.cn). Then, you can subsequently analyze the data using MSThunder after our process the raw data in a Linux system and return the converted file. We also provide a tutorial video named “Guideline.mp4” for the use of MSThunder.

The model and interface of MSThunder were written by Python 3.10.5 with associated packages, consisting of PySide6 6.6.0, torch 1.13.0+cu116, numpy 1.23.4, matplotlib 3.6.2, rdkit 2023.9.2, adjustText 0.8, tqdm 4.64.1, pubchempy 1.0.4 and pandas 1.5.0.
